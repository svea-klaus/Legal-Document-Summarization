# Legal-Document-Summarization

This corpus is for the paper "Summarizing Legal Regulatory Documents using Transformers" (https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531872) accepted for SIGIR 2022, Proceedings of the 45th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR ’22), July 11–15, 2022, Madrid, Spain. ACM, New York, NY, USA.

To address the growing need to summarize texts in domains other than news, we introduce a novel version of the EUR-Lex. To our knowledge, the data has not been

The texts are intended for a non-specialist audience and structured into 32 policy fields (such as Energy, Public Health, or Taxation).
