To address the growing need to summarize texts in domains other than news, we introduce a novel version of the EUR-Lex. To our knowledge, the data has not been

However, as aforementioned, the legal domain especially benefits from effective models because it entails a large amount of judicial terminology that lay summaries have to grasp as well. The texts are intended for a non-specialist audience and structured into 32 policy fields (such as Energy, Public Health, or Taxation).
